# Seizure detection using machine learning

This is an open project to check if ML models can achieve a high accuracy to detect ictal period of epilepsy patients

## Data
Data is taken from CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database. The CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, a collection of EEG recordings of 22 pediatric subjects with intractable seizures, is now available. Subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication to characterize seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention. In all, the onsets and ends of 182 seizures are annotated.

## Description

The program is designed to develop machine learning algorithms that can detect if a patient had
a seizure attack for a time duration. Seizure data collected from CHB-MIT is vast and had a record
for multiple patients. The goal was to check if it can be patient-unspecific. Data imbalance was present.
So SMOTE and RUS was used to balance the data.
